Computer Vision Ball Detection Software developed my Kush and me for our FRC team 2638.

2022 FRC game had game pieces resembling large tennis balls in which the robot had to shoot in. 
We developed an algo that uses thresholding, and some geometry in order to determine where balls 
were located, as well as calculating their distance, and angle offset based on their location in
the camera view, and their size.
